title: About Me
---

I'm Shon, a local boy from the island of Hawaii who was raised on a coffee farm and moved across the country to pursue my passion for data. I am an aspiring data scientist who has experience performing data manipulation, data visualization, exploratory data analysis, automation, statistics, and machine learning in R, Python, and SQL.

I attended the University of California, Santa Barbara and graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Statistics in 2018. It was there in university where I joined [Data Science at UCSB](https://datascienceucsb.org/) and discovered my passion for the field of data.

Most recently, I was a Content Quality Data Analyst at [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/), where I worked with instructors to improve their course ratings by analyzing student feedback and engagement data.

I currently live in New York and am looking for opportunities as a data analyst. Add me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shoninouye/) or send me an [email](mailto:shoninouye@gmail.com) if you'd like to connect!
